## 🎤 SAMPLE CONVERSATION WITH YOUR GUIDE

### Guide: "What is app.py?"
**You**: "That's the main Flask web application. It runs the web server, loads the trained model, and serves the detection interface with API endpoints for statistics and detection results."

### Guide: "Why do you have so many Python files?"
**You**: "The project follows modular design. The src/ folder contains separate modules for data preprocessing, model definitions, feature engineering, and intrusion detection. This makes the code organized and maintainable."

### Guide: "What's in the models folder?"
**You**: "That contains our trained Random Forest model (22 MB) which achieves 87% accuracy, the StandardScaler for feature normalization, and a lightweight backup model. These are the actual trained models ready for deployment."

### Guide: "Why is the dataset so large?"
**You**: "The dataset is 2.4 GB because it contains 11 years of daily consumption data (2014-2025) for thousands of customers. However, the application only loads 1,000 customers at a time for performance optimization."

### Guide: "What are these training scripts for?"
**You**: "Those are the scripts I used to train the models. They're not needed to run the application since the models are already trained, but I kept them for reproducibility and reference."

### Guide: "Why do you have multiple documentation files?"
**You**: "I organized the documentation for different purposes - START_HERE for navigation, README for complete details, QUICKSTART for quick setup, and PRESENTATION_GUIDE for demo preparation. Additional technical docs are archived in docs/archive/."

### Guide: "Can you explain the results folder?"
**You**: "That contains proof of model performance - training_results.json with metrics (87% accuracy, 0.91 AUC), a human-readable summary, and visualization plots like confusion matrices and feature importance charts."
