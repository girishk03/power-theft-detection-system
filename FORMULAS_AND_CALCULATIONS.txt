CONFUSION MATRIX:
-----------------
                    PREDICTED
                 Theft    Non-Theft
ACTUAL  Theft     TP         FN
        Non-Theft FP         TN

Where:
- TP = True Positives (correctly identified theft)
- TN = True Negatives (correctly identified non-theft)
- FP = False Positives (incorrectly flagged as theft)
- FN = False Negatives (missed theft cases)


ACCURACY:
---------
Formula: Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

Example: (870 + 8700) / (870 + 8700 + 160 + 180) = 9570 / 10910 = 0.87 = 87%

Interpretation: Model correctly classifies 87% of all cases


PRECISION:
----------
Formula: Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Example: 870 / (870 + 160) = 870 / 1030 = 0.84 = 84%

Interpretation: When model flags theft, it's correct 84% of the time
(Low false positive rate)


RECALL (SENSITIVITY):
---------------------
Formula: Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

Example: 870 / (870 + 180) = 870 / 1050 = 0.82 = 82%

Interpretation: Model catches 82% of actual theft cases
(Misses 18% of theft cases)


F1-SCORE:
---------
Formula: F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

Example: 2 × (0.84 × 0.82) / (0.84 + 0.82)
       = 2 × 0.6888 / 1.66
       = 1.3776 / 1.66
       = 0.83 = 83%

Interpretation: Harmonic mean of precision and recall (balanced metric)


SPECIFICITY:
------------
Formula: Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

Example: 8700 / (8700 + 160) = 8700 / 8860 = 0.98 = 98%

Interpretation: Model correctly identifies 98% of non-theft cases


FALSE POSITIVE RATE (FPR):
--------------------------
Formula: FPR = FP / (FP + TN) = 1 - Specificity

Example: 160 / (160 + 8700) = 160 / 8860 = 0.018 = 1.8%

Interpretation: Only 1.8% of non-theft cases are incorrectly flagged


FALSE NEGATIVE RATE (FNR):
--------------------------
Formula: FNR = FN / (FN + TP) = 1 - Recall

Example: 180 / (180 + 870) = 180 / 1050 = 0.17 = 17%

Interpretation: 17% of actual theft cases are missed


AUC-ROC (Area Under Curve):
---------------------------
Formula: AUC = ∫[0 to 1] TPR(FPR) d(FPR)

Where:
- TPR = True Positive Rate = Recall
- FPR = False Positive Rate

Our AUC = 0.91 (Outstanding)

Interpretation:
- 0.5 = Random guessing
- 0.7-0.8 = Acceptable
- 0.8-0.9 = Excellent
- 0.9-1.0 = Outstanding


================================================================================
                    2. STATISTICAL FEATURES FORMULAS
================================================================================

MEAN (AVERAGE CONSUMPTION):
---------------------------
Formula: μ = (Σ xi) / n

Where:
- xi = daily consumption values
- n = number of days

Example: (20 + 25 + 22 + 18 + 30) / 5 = 115 / 5 = 23 kWh

Interpretation: Average daily consumption


STANDARD DEVIATION:
-------------------
Formula: σ = √[Σ(xi - μ)² / n]

Example: 
μ = 23
σ = √[(20-23)² + (25-23)² + (22-23)² + (18-23)² + (30-23)²] / 5
  = √[9 + 4 + 1 + 25 + 49] / 5
  = √[88 / 5]
  = √17.6
  = 4.2 kWh

Interpretation: Measures consumption variability (high σ = irregular pattern)


VARIANCE:
---------
Formula: σ² = Σ(xi - μ)² / n

Example: σ² = 17.6 kWh²

Interpretation: Square of standard deviation


MINIMUM VALUE:
--------------
Formula: min(x) = smallest value in dataset

Example: min(20, 25, 22, 18, 30) = 18 kWh


MAXIMUM VALUE:
--------------
Formula: max(x) = largest value in dataset

Example: max(20, 25, 22, 18, 30) = 30 kWh


RANGE:
------
Formula: Range = max(x) - min(x)

Example: 30 - 18 = 12 kWh

Interpretation: Spread of consumption values


COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (CV):
-------------------------------
Formula: CV = (σ / μ) × 100%

Example: (4.2 / 23) × 100% = 18.3%

Interpretation: Normalized measure of variability
- High CV (>30%) = Irregular consumption (suspicious)
- Low CV (<15%) = Regular consumption (normal)


================================================================================
                    3. PREPROCESSING FORMULAS
================================================================================

STANDARDIZATION (Z-SCORE NORMALIZATION):
----------------------------------------
Formula: z = (x - μ) / σ

Where:
- x = original value
- μ = mean of feature
- σ = standard deviation of feature

Example: 
If x = 30 kWh, μ = 23 kWh, σ = 4.2 kWh
z = (30 - 23) / 4.2 = 7 / 4.2 = 1.67

Interpretation: Value is 1.67 standard deviations above mean


MIN-MAX NORMALIZATION:
----------------------
Formula: x_norm = (x - min) / (max - min)

Example:
If x = 25, min = 18, max = 30
x_norm = (25 - 18) / (30 - 18) = 7 / 12 = 0.58

Interpretation: Scales values to [0, 1] range


LINEAR INTERPOLATION (MISSING VALUES):
---------------------------------------
Formula: y = y1 + (x - x1) × (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

Where:
- (x1, y1) = known point before missing value
- (x2, y2) = known point after missing value
- x = position of missing value

Example:
Day 1: 20 kWh
Day 2: ? (missing)
Day 3: 26 kWh

Interpolated value = 20 + (2-1) × (26-20) / (3-1)
                   = 20 + 1 × 6 / 2
                   = 20 + 3
                   = 23 kWh


SMOTE (SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVERSAMPLING):
----------------------------------------
Formula: x_new = x_i + λ × (x_nn - x_i)

Where:
- x_i = minority class sample (theft case)
- x_nn = nearest neighbor of x_i in feature space
- λ = random number between 0 and 1

Example:
If x_i = [20, 5, 10] and x_nn = [24, 7, 12], λ = 0.5
x_new = [20, 5, 10] + 0.5 × ([24, 7, 12] - [20, 5, 10])
      = [20, 5, 10] + 0.5 × [4, 2, 2]
      = [20, 5, 10] + [2, 1, 1]
      = [22, 6, 11]

Interpretation: Creates synthetic theft examples between existing ones

IMPORTANCE IN OUR PROJECT:
SMOTE is crucial for handling the 14% theft rate imbalance. Without SMOTE, the
model would be biased toward predicting "non-theft" for all cases. SMOTE creates
synthetic theft cases during training, ensuring the model learns theft patterns
effectively. This is applied during the model training phase using scikit-learn's
imblearn library.

VALIDITY: ✓ Valid and essential for imbalanced dataset handling


================================================================================
                    4. MODEL CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

RANDOM FOREST PREDICTION:
--------------------------
Formula: P(theft) = (Number of trees voting "theft") / (Total trees)

Example:
100 trees in Random Forest
73 trees vote "theft"
27 trees vote "non-theft"

P(theft) = 73 / 100 = 0.73 = 73%

Interpretation: 73% probability of theft

HOW IT WORKS IN OUR PROJECT:
Our Random Forest model consists of 100 decision trees. Each tree independently
analyzes the customer's consumption features (mean, std, min, max, trends) and
votes whether the pattern indicates theft or not. The final theft probability
is the percentage of trees that voted "theft".

For example:
- If 85 trees vote "theft" → 85% theft probability → HIGH RISK
- If 55 trees vote "theft" → 55% theft probability → MEDIUM RISK  
- If 25 trees vote "theft" → 25% theft probability → LOW RISK

VALIDITY: ✓ Valid - This is the standard Random Forest ensemble voting mechanism


GINI IMPURITY (DECISION TREE SPLITTING):
-----------------------------------------
Formula: Gini = 1 - Σ(pi²)

Where:
- pi = probability of class i at a node
- Σ = sum over all classes (theft and non-theft)

Example:
Node with 70 theft cases, 30 non-theft cases
p_theft = 70/100 = 0.7
p_non_theft = 30/100 = 0.3

Gini = 1 - (0.7² + 0.3²)
     = 1 - (0.49 + 0.09)
     = 1 - 0.58
     = 0.42

Interpretation: Lower Gini = purer node (better split)

Gini = 0 means perfect purity (all samples in node are same class)
Gini = 0.5 means maximum impurity (50-50 split between classes)

HOW IT'S USED IN OUR PROJECT:
Each decision tree in our Random Forest uses Gini impurity to decide how to
split the data at each node. The tree evaluates different features (mean
consumption, std deviation, etc.) and chooses the split that minimizes Gini
impurity, creating the purest possible child nodes.

For example, if splitting on "mean consumption < 15 kWh" creates:
- Left node: 90% theft, 10% non-theft (Gini = 0.18) - Very pure!
- Right node: 20% theft, 80% non-theft (Gini = 0.32) - Good purity

This split would be chosen because it creates purer nodes than alternatives.

VALIDITY: ✓ Valid - Standard criterion for decision tree splitting in scikit-learn


INFORMATION GAIN:
-----------------
Formula: IG = Entropy(parent) - Σ[(ni/n) × Entropy(child_i)]

Where:
- Entropy = -Σ(pi × log2(pi))
- ni = samples in child node i
- n = total samples in parent
- pi = probability of class i

Example:
Parent: 50 theft, 50 non-theft
Entropy_parent = -(0.5×log2(0.5) + 0.5×log2(0.5)) = 1.0

After split on "consumption < 20 kWh":
Left child: 40 theft, 10 non-theft (50 samples)
Right child: 10 theft, 40 non-theft (50 samples)

Entropy_left = -(0.8×log2(0.8) + 0.2×log2(0.2)) = 0.72
Entropy_right = -(0.2×log2(0.2) + 0.8×log2(0.8)) = 0.72

IG = 1.0 - [(50/100)×0.72 + (50/100)×0.72]
   = 1.0 - 0.72
   = 0.28

Interpretation: Higher IG = better split (more information gained)

RELATIONSHIP TO GINI:
Information Gain (entropy-based) and Gini Impurity are alternative splitting
criteria. Both measure node purity:
- Information Gain: Based on entropy (information theory)
- Gini Impurity: Based on probability (faster to compute)

Our Random Forest uses Gini by default (scikit-learn default), but Information
Gain would produce similar results. Both are mathematically valid approaches.

VALIDITY: ✓ Valid - Alternative splitting criterion, equivalent to Gini in practice


WEIGHTED AVERAGE (ENSEMBLE):
-----------------------------
Formula: y_pred = Σ(wi × yi) / Σ(wi)

Where:
- wi = weight of model i
- yi = prediction of model i

Example:
Model 1 (weight=0.6): predicts 0.8 theft probability
Model 2 (weight=0.4): predicts 0.6 theft probability

y_pred = (0.6×0.8 + 0.4×0.6) / (0.6 + 0.4)
       = (0.48 + 0.24) / 1.0
       = 0.72 = 72% theft probability


================================================================================
                    5. RISK CLASSIFICATION FORMULAS
================================================================================

RISK LEVEL CLASSIFICATION:
--------------------------
Formula: 
If P(theft) > 0.70:  Risk = HIGH
If 0.40 ≤ P(theft) ≤ 0.70:  Risk = MEDIUM
If P(theft) < 0.40:  Risk = LOW

Example:
Customer A: P(theft) = 0.85 → HIGH RISK
Customer B: P(theft) = 0.55 → MEDIUM RISK
Customer C: P(theft) = 0.25 → LOW RISK


THEFT PROBABILITY CALCULATION:
-------------------------------
Formula: P(theft) = f(features) where f is Random Forest model

Features include:
- Mean consumption
- Standard deviation
- Min/Max values
- Temporal patterns
- Rolling statistics

Example:
Input: [μ=15, σ=8, min=2, max=35, ...]
Random Forest processes through 100 trees
Output: P(theft) = 0.73


EXPECTED CONSUMPTION:
---------------------
Formula: E(consumption) = μ_neighborhood + adjustment_factors

Where:
- μ_neighborhood = average consumption of similar customers
- adjustment_factors = seasonal, weather, occupancy adjustments

Example:
μ_neighborhood = 25 kWh
Seasonal factor = 1.2 (summer)
E(consumption) = 25 × 1.2 = 30 kWh


CONSUMPTION DEVIATION:
----------------------
Formula: Deviation = (Actual - Expected) / Expected × 100%

Example:
Actual = 15 kWh
Expected = 30 kWh
Deviation = (15 - 30) / 30 × 100% = -50%

Interpretation: 50% below expected (suspicious)


================================================================================
                    6. FEATURE ENGINEERING FORMULAS
================================================================================

ROLLING MEAN (MOVING AVERAGE):
-------------------------------
Formula: MA_t = (x_t + x_{t-1} + ... + x_{t-n+1}) / n

Where:
- n = window size
- t = current time point

Example (7-day moving average):
Days: [20, 22, 25, 23, 21, 24, 26]
MA_7 = (20 + 22 + 25 + 23 + 21 + 24 + 26) / 7 = 161 / 7 = 23 kWh


ROLLING STANDARD DEVIATION:
----------------------------
Formula: σ_rolling = √[Σ(xi - μ_rolling)² / n]

Example (7-day rolling std):
Using same data as above, μ_rolling = 23
σ_rolling = √[(9 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 9) / 7]
          = √[28 / 7]
          = √4
          = 2 kWh


TREND CALCULATION:
------------------
Formula: Trend = (Current_period_avg - Previous_period_avg) / Previous_period_avg

Example:
Previous month avg = 25 kWh
Current month avg = 20 kWh
Trend = (20 - 25) / 25 = -0.20 = -20%

Interpretation: 20% decrease (suspicious)


PEAK-TO-AVERAGE RATIO:
-----------------------
Formula: PAR = Peak_consumption / Average_consumption

Example:
Peak = 45 kWh
Average = 25 kWh
PAR = 45 / 25 = 1.8

Interpretation: Peak is 1.8× average (normal range: 1.5-2.5)


CONSUMPTION VOLATILITY:
-----------------------
Formula: Volatility = σ / μ

Example:
σ = 5 kWh
μ = 25 kWh
Volatility = 5 / 25 = 0.20 = 20%

Interpretation: Higher volatility = more irregular (suspicious)


PERCENTILE CALCULATION:
-----------------------
Formula: P_k = Value at position (k/100) × (n+1)

Where:
- k = percentile (e.g., 25, 50, 75)
- n = number of values

Example (25th percentile):
Sorted data: [10, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, 40]
n = 9
Position = (25/100) × (9+1) = 0.25 × 10 = 2.5
P_25 = value between 2nd and 3rd position
     = 15 + 0.5 × (18-15)
     = 15 + 1.5
     = 16.5 kWh


ANOMALY SCORE:
--------------
Formula: Anomaly_score = |x - μ| / σ

Example:
x = 10 kWh (actual consumption)
μ = 25 kWh (mean)
σ = 5 kWh (std dev)

Anomaly_score = |10 - 25| / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3.0

Interpretation: 3 standard deviations from mean (highly anomalous)
